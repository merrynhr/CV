## Merryn Hurley-Rawlins

In September 2020 I left my job as a teacher in Jakarta and decided to teach myself to code. Despite little prior experience with programming, other than using R at university, I found myself getting hooked. Given my background as a teacher, I am particularly interested in e-learning tools. The importance of developing engaging online education tools has become increasingly clear throughout the covid-19 pandemic. In the future I would love to find ways of bringing together my interests in both programming and teaching.

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)
