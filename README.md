## Merryn Hurley-Rawlins

In September 2020 I left my job as a teacher in Jakarta and decided to teach myself to code. Despite little prior experience with programming, other than using R at university, I found myself getting hooked. Given my background as a teacher, I am particularly interested in e-learning tools. The importance of developing engaging online education tools has become increasingly clear throughout the covid-19 pandemic. In the future I would love to find ways of bringing together my interests in both programming and teaching. 
In May 2021 I joined Makers Academy for 12 weeks of intensive group based learning taking me from keen amateur to well rounded junior developer. Makers not only boosted my programming confidence but taught me to love pair programming and working in teams to create projects from the ground up.

- While working as a teacher effective time managment skills were essential both in terms of managing my own resources and those of my students.

_Work Experience_
- Two weeks working an intellectually stimulating and highly demanding environment where attention to detail (especially while working with expensive equipment) was key.
- In this role I was tasked with extracting DNA from mouse liver cells and then helped to run a quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction, using an ultra-violet probe. 

## Skills

#### Ability to associate and combine areas of knowledge 

- During my final project at Makers, our team had difficulty agreeing on which tech stack to use. Some members of the group wanted to focus on JavaScript, others on Ruby. We all wanted to ensure we made use of frameworks regularly used in the industry. Eventually I suggested that we used Ruby on Rails as an API on the backend and React on the frontend, allowing everyone in the group to focus on their own priorites. This also allowed us to practice using technologies like Postman and Insomia to test our Rails API. 

#### Adaptability and initiative

- While living in Jakarta as an English teacher, I spent time working with a dyslexic Iraqi refugee who was struggling to learn to read and write. His speaking ability was very strong and it was clear that he was a talented and motivated student. It became difficult to teach the class because my dyslexic student was unable to keep up with comprehension tasks my other students needed to practice. After realizing that my student lived nearby my apartment block, I spoke to my student's parents and to my supervisor and I decided that I would offer free tutoring sessions to the student. We spent 2 hours a week working on phonics. This allowed my student to catch up with the rest of his classmates. I remain in touch with his family.
