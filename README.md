## Merryn Hurley-Rawlins

In September 2020 I left my job as a teacher in Jakarta and decided to teach myself to code. Despite little prior experience with programming, other than using R at university, I found myself getting hooked. Given my background as a teacher, I am particularly interested in e-learning tools. The importance of developing engaging online education tools has become increasingly clear throughout the covid-19 pandemic. In the future I would love to find ways of bringing together my interests in both programming and teaching.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.


-Using "R" for statistical programming at university. (ST)

-Used Bayesian inference to construct a tree model of cultural change over time.

-One week of work experience at the at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics (October, 2013) where I was tasked with extracting DNA from mouse liver cells and then helped to run a quanti-tative Polymerase Chain Reaction, using an ultra-violet probe.



#### This Skill

- During my final project at Makers, had difficulty agreeing on which tech stack to use. Some members of the group wanted to focus on JavaScript, others on Ruby. We all wanted to ensure we made use of frameworks regularly used in the industry. Eventually I suggested that we used Ruby on Rails as an API on the backend and React on the frontend, allowing everyone in the group to focus on their own priorites. This also allowed us to practice using technologies like Postman and Insomia to test our Rails API. 

#### Another Skill

- While living in Jakarta as an English teacher, I spent time working with a dyslexic Iraqi refugee who was struggling to learn to read and write. His speaking ability was very strong and it was clear that he was a talented and motivated student. It became difficult to teach the class because my dyslexic student was unable to keep up with comprehension tasks my other students needed to practice. After realizing that my student lived nearby my apartment block, I spoke to my students parents and to my supervisor and I decided that I would offer free tutoring sessions to the student. We spent 2 hours a week working on phonics. This allowed the students to catch up with the rest of their classmates and learn to read and write. I remain in touch with his family.
